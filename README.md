# Economy

A FabricMC mod that implements a complete global banking and currency system for minecraft. Includes gold, silver and copper coins that drop as physical inventory items from mobs (user configurable, supports custom mod monsters) that convert upwards at 64, a banking chest container that allows deposits and transfers the physical currency to virtual shared across all bank chests, withdrawals, and the creation/cashing of Bank Notes for the exchange of large sums of money.

API contains functionality for other mods to expand upon this for vending purposes, including ability to debit users and accept coin. Check out BARKx4/Vending for NPC vendors that use this system and support both player and admin ownership.
